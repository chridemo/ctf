Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks and unauthorized access. Sensitive information such as passwords, financial data, or personal details must be kept secure to prevent any identity theft.

To prevent any sort of attacks companies must do penetration testing which is a controlled simulation of a cyber attack. Its goal is to discover vulnerabilities before an attacker does. 

Every penetration tester should follow a step by step approach to identify vulnerabilities of a target system. Methods may vary depending on scope and tools, but the general steps are:

---


- **[[01 - Scanning & Discovery]]** (Find live hosts and open ports) <br><br>
- **[[02 - Service Enumeration]]** (Identify running services and versions)<br><br>
- **[[03 - Vulnerability Research]]** (Check for known weaknesses)<br><br>
- **[[04 - Privilege Escalation]]** (Gain higher system access)<br><br>
- **[[05 - Cleanup & Restoration]]** (Remove traces and restore systems)<br><br>
- **[[06 - Reporting & Documentation]]** (Summarize findings and recommendations)
